3. Scroll to the very bottom where it says "Themes" and click "Upload a theme"
4. Drag the downloaded zip folder from step 1 to upload

2. Add that tag to the navigation under Ghost Admin -> Settings -> Navigation

3. Create a new post and add the tag of **Portfolio**

###Add a Featured Project

2. Create a new post, tag it with **Featured Project** - note, it looks best with an image!

####Notes & Resources

This theme was built upon the original Ghost Casper theme and is a modifed version. I do not claim to have created this fully on my own and I am opening it up for others to use with no liability on myself.
