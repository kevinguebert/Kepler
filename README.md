# Kepler 

Welcome to Kepler! 

Kepler is a Ghost theme built off of the default Ghost theme, [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases). Built around large front page images and the ability to have portfolio items, Kepler is fast, responsive, and can be used in a wide variety of situations.


## Installation & Instruction

1. Download the zip file of the latest release.
2. Go to your Ghost Admin -> Settings -> General
3. Scroll to the very bottom where it says "Themes" and click "Upload a theme"
4. Drag the downloaded zip folder from step 1 to upload

###Create "Portfolio" Page

1. Create a tag called **Portfolio**
2. Add that tag to the navigation under Ghost Admin -> Settings -> Navigation
	(Note, the tag will be `../tag/portfolio`
3. Create a new post and add the tag of **Portfolio**

###Add a Featured Project

1. Create a tag called **Featured Project**
2. Create a new post, tag it with **Featured Project** - note, it looks best with an image!
